** What is Emacs?
#+begin_quote 
An extensible, customizable, free/libre text editor — and more.
At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text editing

** What is Emacs?
🤙
#+begin_quote 
Emacs outshines all other editing software in approximately the same way that
the noonday sun does the stars. It is not just bigger and brighter; it simply
makes everything else vanish.
-- *Neal Stephenson, In the Beginning was the Command Line (1998)*
